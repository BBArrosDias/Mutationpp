Mutation++
==========

MUlticomponent Thermodynamic And Transport properties for partially IONized gases in C++ is an open-source library developed at the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics, designed to couple with conventional CFD codes to provide thermodynamic, transport, chemistry, and energy transfer properties associated with subsonic to hypersonic flows.
