Contribution Guide
==================

## Workflow

Choice has been made to follow a workflow close to the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html). This simple workflow displays the following features:

* Heavy use of branching: any new feature of fix is implemented in a dedicated branch, which is then merged into the `master` branch.
* Limited direct commits to the central repository: all contributors work on their own fork of the project and submit their changes through pull requests.

The central repository only features one active branch---the `master` branch. This workflow might evolve into something more similar to the [GitLab flow](https://about.gitlab.com/2014/09/29/gitlab-flow/) in the future, depending on whether or not the need for release tracking emerges.

## Getting started

If you want to contribute to Mutation++, fork the central repository and branch the `master` branch into a feature branch. To keep your fork in sync with the upstream repository, follow [these instructions]( https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).

When you deem it is time to have your changes merged back into the central repository, submit a merge request. Your code will be reviewed and you will get feedback on your work.
